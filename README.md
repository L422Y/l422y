# I'm Larry, a senior full-stack engineer and creative technologist ðŸ‘‹
I've been doing everything computer related most of my life and bring over twenty years of real-world experience in software, web development, interactive, automation, performance optimization, and user experience.

### Around the age of nine, when we got our first IBM compatible PC, nobody knew much about it. Being a curious kid, I dove in head first.

Nobody around knew a lot about computers, I had to learn on my own. Fixing IRQ conflicts (so I could connect to online services without moving the mouse) drove me deeper into the inner workings of a computer. It was not long before I was coding in BASIC. Google did not yet exist, most of the learning process was trial by fire. Eventually, with the help of some friends, I made my way onto BBSes, eventually, and the internet using SLIP/PPP or shell accounts. I began scripting automation routines PROCOMM PLUS for DOS so that it would play a MUD (text-based online game) for me while I was 'learning' things at school.

Around the time I got into text-based games, I began frequenting Internet Relay Chat, or IRC. I started scripting for Unix based IRC clients like ircII, and writing TCL scripts for Eggdrop bots. Eventually Windows became a bit more user friendly and I moved to GUI applications, writing code in VB, and creating mIRC scripts and DLL plugins. Over time, this evolved into writing software and miscellaneous utilities in languages like C# and Delphi.
I took four years and three summers of web design classes which helped me to develop my PHP and JavaScript skills, and introduced me to Shockwave, Flash (RIP) and ActionScript.

In what seemed like kismet, I was asked to be the junior network administrator at my high school. This included repairing computers, installing networks, and doing maintenance on any and all computers or systems.

By the end of my sophomore year, shortly after achieving the rank of Eagle Scout, I started freelancing. Small jobs like designing and implementing websites, servers and networks for local establishments, writing Excel macros to compile data from thousands of different spreadsheets into comprehensible reports and fixing computers for people. I started bidding for jobs on the internet around the age of seventeen. I would go on to work for a local web design firm, and then move on to an internship at a print and design shop.

I've continued my path over the years, skating along the edge of technical and creative, even being granted two software patents by the age of twenty-three.

I have been freelancing since the early 2000s and continue to be drawn in to anything related to technology. It's basically my life ðŸ˜‡
